                    <h2>Early Events</h2>
                    <p>Urban Ed held a Community Cookout as the start of our new strategic planning process. The event was held on Saturday, August 2, 2008 at Urban Ed. Focus groups and online surveys were conducted to help us begin to better assess the work we do and how we can improve as we look to the future.</p>
                    <p>Our 7th Annual Event last year had a more casual and intimate vibe. The event was held on Wednesday, May 2, 2007 at the beautiful home of Patrick Murphy of mCapitol Management. Patrick opened up his multiple story home located on Capitol Hill to help Urban Ed celebrate seven years of success in serving disadvantaged youth and families from throughout the city.</p>
