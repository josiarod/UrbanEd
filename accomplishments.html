										<p>Urban Ed is a very progressive organization with a committed team that has accomplished a lot in 
											just a small amount of time! Since our launch in southeast DC, we have served over 3,500 children, 
											youth and families; providing over 425,000 hours of technical, career, business and educational skills enhancements.</p>
										<p>Urban Ed has achieved a lot over the years, helping people get the skills and access to information they need, 
											to begin changing their lives for the better. Parents are securing solid skills for permanent full-time
											 employment, with wages that are more than double the minimum wage. Teens are finding better ways to do 
											 things and make better decisions, while endorsing technology and the workplace in ways they never even
											  cared to think about. Children are carving out an advantage, by learning technology skills that improve
											   their education levels and help them leap ahead, instead of falling behind.</p>
                                        <p>The impact of our work is notable and truly does have long-term effect. Families are evading homelessness, and in most cases, our organization assists them in earning enough to get out of homeless shelters or off public assistance rosters. Teens are staying in school, reducing truancy and graduating, in order to work and function properly in professional environments—whether they attend college or go to work immediately after high school. Without Urban Ed, these options are less likely to occur for the vast majority of teens from our neighborhoods. Children are no longer among the 80% that are failing before the fourth grade. They are better prepared to function within their grade level and excited to do so. Urban Ed's overall approach is full circle, starting at the root of the issues by working with children; dealing with the potential to reduce community issues by working with teens; and addressing the existing needs of our community by working with adults and parents.</p>

									I came from poverty. I never owned a car, and never lived in my own place.
									 Before I found Urban Ed, I was stuck in dead-end jobs. After graduating from Urban Ed in 2013, my life changed dramatically.
								</p>

								<p class="mb-0">Now, I have set hours. People take that for granted, but this change has taken away a great deal of stress
									 from my life to have a set schedule. Finding a job for me now is like shooting fish in a barrel.
									  In this industry, you can move very quickly.</p>

                                <p>People don't realize that they can be great; it's just not presented in urban areas -- you're not thinking
									 about IT, that you could start your own business.</p>

                                <p>My life now focused on how to solve issues, and I have a hunger for this. I'll do whatever it takes to get
									 learning and keep moving up.</p>

									Before Urban Ed, I was on a dead end road. I was unhappy and I wanted more.
									 When I came across Urban Ed's website, something inside me said "Go for it."
									  I was so surprised when Ms.Williams invited me in for an interview.
								</p>

                                <p class="mb-0">
									I walked two hours each way, to and from class. I did this until I was offered a 
									job that would pay enough for bus fare and also to put some food in my stomach.
									 I had my face in my books, studying all the time. With Mr. Moore's guidance,
									  I learned more about myself. It chokes me up to think about what my life was like three years ago.
								</p>

                               <p>
								   This has been an awesome adventure. My classmates have become my second family. 
								   All of us from that class have gone on to bigger opportunities. 
								   I felt like we were the chosen ones, overcoming every obstacle to get our certifications.
							   </p>

                               <p>
								   I enjoy what I do, and I feel like I can finally breathe. Building pathways to opportunity 
								   truly hits the nail on the head. The IT world is so big, and I know that I will be prosperous.

								 <p>My dad was a cryptologist you would build computers with me, and I used to take apart and rebuild PlayStations when I was a kid. 
								I knew I wanted to be in tech, but I wasn't sure how I would do it until I discovered Urban Ed.</p>

                                <p class="mb-0">I got a job when I passed my first certification and I am now a contractor with the FDA.
                              I am constantly studying and taking new tests to get new certification so that I can continue to move up.
							   I'm happy to say that I also just bought my first home. I have Miss Williams and Mr. Moore to thank.</p>

								<p class="mb-0">I had been interested in IT for a while and had some experience,
									 but didn't have the costly certifications that I needed to get a job in the field.
									  I was working at the Department of Energy as receptionist; I felt like I was stuck at a stop sign.
									   I was seeking help with getting certifications and found Urban Ed online.
									   What I really liked about Urban Ed is that they not only educated you in the classroom and helped
									    you to get the certifications, but they also gave me hands-on experience, which really made a difference. 
										In fact, Urban Ed's program was so good that my first job was Tier 3, which is the top level of IT Support at a Help Desk;
										 that's really cool. Because of Urban Ed, I was able to afford my IT training that has allowed 
										 me to get a great job in the field I want, and if everything goes right,
									 I'll have two more certifications finished before the end of the year.</p>

								<p class="mb-0">I was 55 or 56 when I enrolled in Urban Ed. I was looking for something different, 
									something interesting to do. I went to Urban Ed during the day, and I worked at night.
									 I was so tired all the time, but I still went. I had to be there, for the other students. 
									 These kids come from the streets, and you can get lost so easily in these urban areas.
									  I believe that God put me there in that classroom to share my history and to help these kids keep going,
									   because, you know it's hard, really hard. These kids don't have opportunities,
									    and I felt like it was my responsibility to help them continue their education.
										 The truth is that if these kids just sacrifice one year of their lives, 
										 they can change their whole lives.
								</p>
								<p>I loved going to class. I was always good with my hands, and knew something about computers,
									 but Mr. Sterling was able to really teach us concepts and help us understand why things work like they do.
									  He would take a piece of the computer out and tell us to figure out how to put it back together.
									   I learned a lot - so much. Mr. Sterling made learning about computers as easy as catching a bus. Now, even years later, 
									I am using what I've learned to help people around me repair their computers. And, I feel I have so much to learn.</p>
                                <p>I love Urban Ed. They are like family to me - especially Roxanne - she is amazing the way she cares about the students.
									 I still visit students at Urban Ed and I push them and I tell them that I wish this were around when I was young, 
									because it would have changed my life so much earlier.</p>
